## Slide 2 – The Problem (0:15 – 0:30)
**Visuals:**

- A startup founder paying huge legal fees.  

**Narration:**  
"Legal documents are filled with complex terms and long sentences.  
Most people struggle to understand them, startups spend thousands on legal help,  
and citizens often sign papers without fully knowing their rights.  
This creates confusion, costs, and sometimes injustice."

**Narration:**  
"That’s where **LexiGen AI** comes in.  
Our platform lets you upload any contract or policy,  
instantly generates a **plain-language summary**,  
and allows you to ask questions like *‘What does this clause mean?’*.  
In seconds, you get clear, accurate answers."
